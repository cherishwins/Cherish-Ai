> **About this copy (cherishwins/Cherish-Ai).** This is a fork of ArnabTechiee/Chetna
> (https://github.com/ArnabTechiee/Chetna), unmodified up to commit `8f6e50a`.
> It is not a Cherish product, it is not maintained here, and it must not be deployed.
> **No licence is granted:** there is no LICENSE file, so the MIT badge below grants nothing.
> The code and the text below are the work of the Chetna team listed under Contributors,
> apart from the changes listed here. Claims in this README and in the app screens have not
> been verified, and the Live Demos links are the upstream team's deployments.
>
> **Changes in this fork.** The hard-coded default caregiver phone number was removed, so an
> SOS with no caregiver set sends no SMS. The Gemini and OpenWeatherMap keys are no longer in
> the code: pass them at build time with `--dart-define=GEMINI_API_KEY=...` (dashboard) and
> `--dart-define=OWM_API_KEY=...` (app). `chetna_app/android/app/google-services.json` is no
> longer tracked; supply your own. The upstream team's keys remain in this fork's git history
> and in the upstream repository, and only their owner can rotate them.

## 🚀 About the Project
Chetna bridges the gap between reactive emergency response and proactive wellness monitoring. It features a dual-interface system consisting of a user-facing mobile application and a Caregiver Dashboard tailored for guardians and healthcare professionals. By leveraging on-device machine learning (TensorFlow Lite) and the Gemini API, Chetna ensures high privacy, low latency, and continuous protection against the "Silent Gap" in emergency response.

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Edge AI Fall Detection
* **On-Device 1D-CNN:** Processes accelerometer and gyroscope data directly on the user's device.
* **3-Phase Fall Signature:** Accurately classifies falls by detecting Free-fall, Impact, and Stillness, drastically reducing false positives.

### 2. Proactive Wellness & Environmental Monitoring
* **Sensor Fusion:** Aggregates real-time data across Light, Noise, Temperature, and Air Quality Index (AQI).
* **Gemini AI Risk Detection:** Automatically flags potential environmental hazards, such as Sensory Overload and Respiratory Risk, before they become emergencies.

### 3. Comprehensive Emergency Protocol
* **Smart Cancellation:** Features a 15-second cancellation window to prevent false alarms.
* **Multi-Modal SOS:** Dispatches instant alerts to the Caregiver Dashboard, activates a loud device siren, and triggers heavy vibrations.
* **Chetna Voice Guardian:** A hands-free, NLP voice-activated SOS protocol for situations where physical interaction with the device is impossible (the "Physical Lock").
* **Psychological First Aid:** Triggers a "Trusted Voice" audio loop during emergencies to reduce user panic while help arrives.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### 📱 Mobile Application
* **Frontend:** Flutter / Dart for a responsive, cross-platform user interface.
* **Edge AI & Offline Intelligence:** TensorFlow Lite executing our custom 2-step fall detection algorithm directly on the device.

### 💻 Backend & Dashboard
* **Cloud & Database:** Cloud Firebase for real-time data syncing, secure authentication, and dashboard hosting.
* **AI Integrations:** Gemini API for generating proactive environmental wellness insights.

## ⚙️ Getting Started

### ✅ Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine before proceeding:
* **Git:** For version control and cloning the repository.
* **Flutter:** For building and running the mobile application.
* **Python:** For backend data processing and model tuning.

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### ✅ Prerequisites
To build and run this application, you will need:
* **Flutter SDK:** Version 3.10.0 or higher.
* **Android Studio:** With the latest Android SDK and NDK installed (required for TensorFlow Lite C++ bindings).
* **Physical Device:** A physical Android smartphone is **strictly required** to test the Edge AI Fall Detection, as desktop emulators cannot simulate accelerometer G-force spikes.

### 🔑 Firebase Configuration
For security reasons, the `google-services.json` file is not included in this public repository. 
1. Create a project in your Firebase Console.
2. Add an Android app with the package name `com.example.chetna` (or your specific package name).
3. Download the `google-services.json` file and place it inside the `chetna_app/android/app/` directory.

---

### 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArnabTechiee/Chetna.git

# Navigate to project
cd Chetna/chetna_app

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

---

## 💡 Usage

### 📱 User Mobile App
* **Initial Setup:** Upon launching the app, grant the necessary hardware permissions (Microphone, Sensors, Location) to enable core safety features.
* **Background Protection:** Once active, the app runs seamlessly in the background to continuously detect falls and listen for Voice Guardian SOS triggers.

### 💻 Caregiver Dashboard
* **Secure Access:** Log into the live Firebase web portal using your designated caregiver credentials.
* **Real-Time Monitoring:** Actively monitor the user's environmental data, review mood logs, and instantly receive automated SOS alerts the moment an emergency is detected.
